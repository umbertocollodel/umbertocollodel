# Hi, I am Umberto!

## 🚀 About me

👨‍🎓 I am a Ph.D. in International Macroeconomics specialized in crises prediction, with a cross-disciplinary passion for data wrangling. In the last two years,
I worked for the International Monetary Fund on a project regarding forecasts evaluation. I also completed some freelancing research assistance in the field of clinical psychology on the link between stress bouts and depression.

🌱 I enjoy learning always something new, to develop and complement my skillset. I just completed an IBM Certification for Data Science in SQL and currently searching for a new challenge.

🏊‍♂️ Outside of work, I am a sport enthusiast. I have been a swimmer for the past 8 years and I am now very enthusiastic about wild swimming. But really, any sport does it for me: football, basketball, volley, you name it...

📚 I love reading fiction books, particularly in foreign languages and adore discovering new words and expressions. I particularly like books with a magic realism
(Murakami, Garcia Marquez) or a zen theme (Salwater Buddha, anyone?).
