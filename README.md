# Hi, I am Umberto!

## 🚀 About me

👨‍🎓 Ph.D. in International Macroeconomics specialized in crises prediction, with a cross-disciplinary passion for data wrangling and modelling. During my doctorate, I worked in different roles for the International Monetary Fund on a data project regarding the evaluation of forecasts. 

🔬 Completed some freelancing research assistance in the field of clinical psychology on the link between stress bouts and depression.

🌱 Enjoy learning always something new, to develop and complement my skillset. I just completed an IBM Certification for Data Science in SQL 

📚 Love reading fiction books, particularly in foreign languages and adore discovering new words and expressions. I particularly like books with a magic realism
(Murakami, Garcia Marquez) or a zen theme (Salwater Buddha, anyone?).

🏊‍♂️ Sport enthusiast. I have been a swimmer for the past 9 years and a footballer for most of my youth.
